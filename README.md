# Dotfiles

A place to keep all the things I don't want to have to generate or write again. 

Will probably contain a bunch of things that aren't dot files.

Might contain little scripts to push all these things into their appropriate final destinations as well, to make myself even lazier in the future. 

`bootstrap.sh` is provided to get everything set up and in place.
