# Dotfiles

A place to keep all the things I don't want to have to generate or write again. 

Will probably contain a bunch of things that aren't dot files.

Might contain little scripts to push all these things into their appropriate final destinations as well, to make myself even lazier in the future. 

`bootstrap.sh` is provided to get everything set up and in place.

This is a little lame, but this uuid: bf56d5b8-5490-4bce-83c4-349a4546bb5a is used as a means to test whether or not the bootstrap script is being run from within a repo that has contents, or from a standalone download.
