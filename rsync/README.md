# Rsync

I've decided to include my `rsync` backup scripts in here for a bunch of reasons:

- It's a safe place to keep them.
- They contain directories that I pretty much always forget contain useful things.
- Reference, if you want to do something with them and backup your stuff. 

These scripts (mostly `backup.sh`) have saved me on a couple of occasions where I've lost things.
